This is just a set of scripts to rebuild a known working kernel for ARM devices.

Script Bugs: "bugs@rcn-ee.com"

Dependencies: GCC ARM Cross ToolChain

Linaro:
http://www.linaro.org/downloads/

Dependencies: Linux Kernel Source

This git repo contains just scripts/patches to build a specific kernel for some
ARM devices. The kernel source will be downloaded when you run any of the build
scripts.

By default this script will clone the linux-stable tree:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git
to: ${DIR}/ignore/linux-src:

If you've already cloned torvalds tree and would like to save some hard drive
space, just modify the LINUX_GIT variable in system.sh to point to your current
git clone directory.

Build Kernel Image:

./build_kernel.sh

Optional: Build Debian Package:

./build_deb.sh

Install Kernel Image to SD card: (requires MMC set in system.sh):

./tools/install_kernel.sh

Install Kernel Image to local system (kernel was built on ARM board):

./tools/local_install.sh

Development/Hacking:

first run (to setup baseline tree): ./build_kernel.sh
then modify files under KERNEL directory
then run (to rebuild with your changes): ./tools/rebuild.sh
