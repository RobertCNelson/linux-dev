Subject: [PATCH] Documentation: dt: add bindings for ti-cpufreq

Add the device tree bindings document for the TI CPUFreq/OPP driver
on AM33xx and AM43xx SoCs. The operating-points-v2 binding allows us
to provide an opp-supported-hw property for each OPP to define when
it is available. This driver is responsible for reading and parsing
registers to determine which OPPs can be selectively enabled based
on the specific SoC in use by matching against the opp-supported-hw
data.

+TI CPUFreq and OPP bindings
+================================
+
+Certain TI SoCs, like those in the am335x, am437x, am57xx, and dra7xx
+families support different OPPs depending on the silicon variant in use.
+The ti_cpufreq driver can use revision and an efuse value from the SoC to
+provide the OPP framework with supported hardware information. This is
+used to determine which OPPs from the operating-points-v2 table get enabled
+when it is parsed by the OPP framework.
+
+Required properties:
+--------------------
+In 'cpus' nodes:
+- operating-points-v2: Phandle to the operating-points-v2 table to use.
+
+In 'operating-points-v2' table:
+- compatible: Should be
+	- 'operating-points-v2-ti' for am335x, am43xx, and dra7xx/am57xx SoCs
+- ti,syscon-efuse: Syscon phandle, offset to efuse register, efuse register
+		   mask, and efuse register shift to get the relevant bits
+		   that describe OPP availability.
+- ti,syscon-rev: Syscon and offset used to look up revision value on SoC.
+
+Optional properties:
+--------------------
+For each opp entry in 'operating-points-v2' table:
+- opp-supported-hw: Two bitfields indicating:
+	1. Which revision of the SoC the OPP is supported by
+	2. Which eFuse bits indicate this OPP is available
+
+	A bitwise AND is performed against these values and if any bit
+	matches, the OPP gets enabled. Not providing the property for an
+	entry indicates that an OPP is always supported.
+
+Example:
+--------
+
+/* From arch/arm/boot/dts/am33xx.dtsi */
+cpus {
+	#address-cells = <1>;
+	#size-cells = <0>;
+	cpu@0 {

+	};
+};

+ * 0x2 and 0x4 have eFuse bits that indicate if they are available or not
