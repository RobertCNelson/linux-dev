Subject: [PATCH 2/2] pwm: Create device class for pwm channels

#https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/6/14/967

Pwm channels don't send uevents when exported, this change adds the
channels to a pwm class and set their device type to pwm_channel so
uevents are sent.

To do this properly, the device names need to change to uniquely
identify a channel.  This change is from pwmN to pwm-(chip->base):N
