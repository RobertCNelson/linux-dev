Subject: [PATCH 15/63] pwm:ehrpwm - Fix duty cycle inversion eHRPWM wave.

Patch fixes the ON and OFF period inversion in PWM wave.
Action qualifier register settings causes switching PWM wave to OFF
period when counter reaches zero and to ON period on counter reaches
compare value. Because of this inversion in duty cycle was observed.
