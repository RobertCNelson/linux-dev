Subject: [PATCH 98/99] ARM: dts: omap5-uevm: Correct twl6040 reset GPIO pinmux

When the omap5-evm.dts file has been renamed to omap5-uevm.dts and the sEVM
support got deprecated in favor of uEVM (or Panda5) the content was not
validated.
On uEVM the twl6040 reset GPIO is from gpio5_141 and not via gpio5_145, which
was the case in sEVM.
