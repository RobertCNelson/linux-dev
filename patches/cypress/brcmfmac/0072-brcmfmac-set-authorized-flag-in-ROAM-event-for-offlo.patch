Subject: [PATCH 072/101] brcmfmac: set authorized flag in ROAM event for
 offload FT roaming

When using PORT_AUTHORIZED event mechanism for offload FT,
wpa_supplicant started a full EAP exchange after a successful roaming.
It was caused by setting portEnabled to FALSE to get EAP state machine
out of the SUCCESS state and eapSuccess cleared when handling ROAM
event in wap_supplicant.

With this patch, the authorized flag in the ROAM event is used to
indicate the connection is authorized. Wpa_supplicant sets portEnabled
according to the flag and no full EAP exchange is performed after the
roaming.
