Subject: [PATCH 022/101] brcmfmac: fix the incorrect return value in
 brcmf_inform_single_bss().

commit bd9944918ceb28ede97f715d209e220db5e92c09 upstream.

The function brcmf_inform_single_bss returns the value as success,
even when the length exceeds the maximum value.
The fix is to send appropriate code on this error.
This issue is observed when SVT reported random fmac crashes
when running their tests and the path was identified from the
crash logs. With this fix the random failure issue in SVT was
resolved.
